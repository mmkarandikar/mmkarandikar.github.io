Hello, my name is <b>Mandar</b>. I'm a PhD student at the University of Bonn. I work at the [Argelander-Institute for Astronomy](https://astro.uni-bonn.de/en) as part of the [Large-scale structure and Cosmology reasearch group](https://astro.uni-bonn.de/~porciani/lss/webpage/index.html). My primary research interests include dark matter modelling and theories of structure formation. I have previously studied at [Fergusson College](https://fergusson.edu/), Pune, where I graduated with a B.Sc. in Physics. I completed my Masters in Astrophysics in Bonn, where I've been living since 2018.
