title: On Halo Assembly
description: Testing models that predict the collapse of halos
importance: 1
category: Work

<p>My current research focus is on understanding halo formation. The big question is to predict the collapse of proto-halos into gravitationally bound structures. The simplest model ignores environmental effects, and assumes spherical symmetry. The collapse of the proto-halo is then determined by an overdensity threshold. In Borzyszkowski et al. 2017<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, simple extensions of this model to include information from the tidal environment were explored for a small selection of halos. Their model asserts that only those proto-halos whose ellipticity is less than 0.5 will accrete mass. In this ongoing work, I'm exploring how these simple models apply to (or can be extended to) halos in a wider range of masses. This will clarify our understanding of the assembly of halos, and pave way for future work on the galaxy-halo connection.

<!-- Although my focus has so far been on building analytical models, an exciting possibility is the use of generative machine learning techniques which predict the sites of halo formation from the initial density field. -->
