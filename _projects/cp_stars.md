A star which shows spectral abnormalities with respect to other stars in its spectral type is classified as <i>chemically peculiar</i>. Six classes of such stars are known, and they tend to lie on the instability strip on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Whether this curious coincidence has a physical reason remains an open question. In this work, I reviewed the classification of these stars using spectral data from the SOPHIE and ELODIE archive.
